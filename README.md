## Project Description
The project aims to analyze and process physiological signals to extract meaningful information and gain insights into human health and well-being. 
- Berger-HRV:
The Berger-HRV project involves the implementation of the Berger algorithm to detect Heart Rate Variability (HRV). 
HRV refers to the variation in time intervals between successive heartbeats. 
By analyzing HRV, valuable information about autonomic nervous system activity and cardiovascular health can be obtained. 
The Berger algorithm is a widely used method for HRV analysis, enabling the identification of various HRV parameters such as heart rate variability indices,
which are important indicators of cardiac health.
