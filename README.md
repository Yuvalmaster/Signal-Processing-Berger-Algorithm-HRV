# ECG Signal Processing using Berger Algorithm for HRV

## Project Overview
The Berger-HRV project aims to analyze and understand Heart Rate Variability by implementing the Berger algorithm. HRV provides insights into the dynamic interactions between the sympathetic and parasympathetic branches of the autonomic nervous system, which regulate heart rate and cardiovascular function. Detections and quantifying HRV, can result in valuable information about cardiac health, stress levels, and overall autonomic nervous system activity.

# Repository Structure
The repository is organized to facilitate easy access to the project resources and implementation of the Berger algorithm. Here's an overview of the main components:

* Functions: this folder contains the implementation of the Berger algorithm for HRV analysis.

* Data: The Data folder includes ECG samples that was used for HRV analysis.
